1. Created the dataset

Defined a table online_sales with columns:
order_id, order_date, amount, product_id.

Inserted sample sales records into it.

2. Applied all aggregation hints

Extracted year and month from order_date using EXTRACT().

Grouped data by year and month.

Calculated total revenue with SUM(amount).

Counted unique orders with COUNT(DISTINCT order_id).

Ordered results chronologically with ORDER BY.

Limited results to a specific period (e.g., only 2023).

3. Ran the final query

Produced a results table showing revenue and orders per month.

4. Generated insights

The results help identify monthly sales trends, showing how revenue and order volume change over time.

---Outcome

You successfully learned how to group data by time periods and use aggregation functions for trend analysis.

This approach can now be reused for business reporting, forecasting, and sales monitoring.
