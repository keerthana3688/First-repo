The dataset consists of both numerical and categorical features, with a manageable number of missing values primarily concentrated in a few columns. 
Descriptive statistics reveal important trends such as skewed distributions in income and purchase amounts, while categorical analysis highlights dominant groups such as customer segments or regions. 
Visualizations including histograms and boxplots uncover distribution patterns and outliers, whereas scatterplots and pairplots indicate relationships between key variables. 
A correlation heatmap further emphasizes strong positive associations, for instance between salary and purchase amount, while negative relationships such as age and spending behavior are also evident.
 Overall, the analysis reveals clear patterns in customer demographics and purchasing behavior, including differences in spending across age groups, gender, and regions. 
These insights provide a strong foundation for targeted strategies such as customer segmentation, personalized marketing, and improved business decision-making.
